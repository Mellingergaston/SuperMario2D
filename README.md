This project was developed as part of the Technological Programming course at the Universidad Nacional del Sur. The objective was to design and program a platform-style video game, inspired by the classic Mario universe, fully implemented in Java.

To organize the project, we started with the design phase using UML class diagrams. Then, we applied object-oriented programming principles, SOLID principles, and various design patterns to achieve a modular, clear, and maintainable architecture.

The development was carried out as a team, with a total of 5 members, combining design and programming knowledge to achieve the final result.
